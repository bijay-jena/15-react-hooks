## React Hooks & Props

## Managing component state with hooks

## Using other built-in hooks (useContext, useRef, useMemo)

What is useRef?
• It’s a hook that gives you a mutable object which persists between renders.
• Common uses:
• Access DOM nodes directly (e.g., focus an input).
• Store mutable values without re-rendering (like an interval ID or a previous value).

What is useMemo?
• useMemo memoizes a computed value.
• It caches the result until its dependencies change.
• Good for expensive calculations or derived data to avoid unnecessary recalculations on every render.

## Custom hooks and their benefits
